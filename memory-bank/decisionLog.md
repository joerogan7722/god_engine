# Decision Log

## Technical Decisions

### Initial Project Structure (2025-07-12)
Initialized Unknown with a modular architecture using Node.js

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** Project-wide

Rationale:
Established foundation for scalable and maintainable development




### Development Workflow (2025-07-12)
Established initial development workflow and practices

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** Development process

Rationale:
Ensure consistent development process and code quality

Alternatives Considered:
- Ad-hoc development process
- Waterfall methodology



### Documentation Strategy (2025-07-12)
Implemented automated documentation with memory bank

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** Project documentation

Rationale:
Maintain up-to-date project context and decision history

### Shift Self-Improvement Focus to Capability and Autonomy (2025-07-12)
The primary objective for the god_engine's self-improvement efforts will shift from linting/formatting fixes to expanding capabilities, increasing autonomy, and information absorption.

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** Affects problem identification strategies, patch generation logic, goal prioritization, and overall development roadmap.

Rationale:
User feedback emphasizes the need for high-value additions and implementations that directly contribute to the engine's functional growth and independence. This re-prioritization focuses on strategic improvements over mere code hygiene.

Alternatives Considered:
- Continue with linting/formatting fixes (rejected due to low perceived value by user)
- Focus solely on performance optimizations (rejected as too narrow)

### Definition of 'Improvement' for God Engine (2025-07-12)
Improvement will be measured by Capability Expansion (new functionalities, increased operational scope), Increased Autonomy (reduced human intervention, autonomous decision-making, self-correction rate), and Information Absorption (knowledge integration, learning rate).

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** Guides problem identification, patch generation, and goal prioritization mechanisms.

Rationale:
This multi-faceted definition provides clear, measurable metrics for 'positive gain' as requested by the user, aligning with the strategic focus on building blocks for future growth and independence.

Alternatives Considered:


Related Decisions:
- Shift Self-Improvement Focus to Capability and Autonomy

### Dynamic Goal Management Strategy (Capability & Autonomy Focused) (2025-07-12)
Implemented an iterative feedback loop for dynamic goal management, focusing on Continuous Problem Identification (for capability expansion), Impact and Effort Estimation, a Prioritization Engine (weighted by capability and autonomy impact), and Adaptive Goal Generation. Validation will measure actual impact against estimated gain.

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** Affects GoalManager, ProblemIdentificationModule, ExperimentationEngine, and future patch_strategies.

Rationale:
This strategy provides a framework for the god_engine to autonomously identify, prioritize, and implement self-improvements that align with the new definition of 'positive gain'.

Alternatives Considered:


Related Decisions:
- Shift Self-Improvement Focus to Capability and Autonomy
- Definition of 'Improvement' for God Engine

### Implementation Focus: Foundational Building Blocks for Capability & Autonomy (2025-07-12)
Immediate implementation will focus on refining goals.json/Goal class for impact tracking, developing initial 'Capability Discovery' mechanisms (e.g., parsing TODOs for features), creating a 'Learning Agent' concept for information absorption, and prioritizing a 'first autonomous capability' goal.

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** Directly influences the next set of development tasks.

Rationale:
These foundational elements are necessary to enable the new strategic direction of self-improvement.

Alternatives Considered:


Related Decisions:
- Shift Self-Improvement Focus to Capability and Autonomy
- Definition of 'Improvement' for God Engine
- Dynamic Goal Management Strategy (Capability & Autonomy Focused)
